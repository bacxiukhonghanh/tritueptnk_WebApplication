Here are the step by step instructions.

1. Download and install "tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe" from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download.
2. Go to Program Files and click on "MinGW Command Prompt". This will start a DOS prompt with the correct environment for using MinGW with GCC.
3. Within this DOS prompt window, navigate to your GOPATH. For example, I went to C:\go-apps.
4. Enter the following commands: go get -u github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3. Then enter go install github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
5. You are done! go-sqlite3 is now installed and ready for use.
